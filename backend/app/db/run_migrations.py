"""Minimal, dependency-free SQL migration runner.

Scans backend/migrations/*.sql (numbered 0001_, 0002_, ...) in filename order
and applies any file not yet recorded in schema_migrations. Each file runs in
its own transaction and is recorded only after every statement succeeds, so a
partial or failed migration never gets silently skipped on a later startup.

There is no Alembic: this is intentionally a thin layer over what the repo
already does with create_all() + .sql files.
